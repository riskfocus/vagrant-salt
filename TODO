* Tasks

** TODO Move bugs to GitHub.   
        TODO is great, but time to use GitHub tracking
** TODO Config. 
        redo the way configuration is managed.  There should be a
        mapping class from what is specified in the structure to what
        the salt config object needs.  Since the mapping is static, it
        should be configuration, not code

** DONE redo the salt bootstrapping configuration strings.  Right now
        they are json files; they should be dictionaries that get
        rendered into json

** DONE redo the minion mappings.  Minions should 'register' with
        their master, not the reverse.

** DONE redo syndic. Creation should add a key to its master
        "order_masters: True", and add a key to its configuration
        (syndic_master) instead of master
