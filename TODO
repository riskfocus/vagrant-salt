A list of changes for this set of classes

1. redo the way configuration is managed.  There should be a mapping
   class from what is specified in the structure to what the salt
   config object needs.  Since the mapping is static, it should be
   configuration, not code

2. redo the salt bootstrapping configuration strings.  Right now they
   are json files; they should be dictionaries that get rendered into json

3. redo the minion mappings.  Minions should 'register' with their
   master, not the reverse.

4. redo syndic. Creation should add a key to its master
   "order_masters: True", and add a key to its configuration
   (syndic_master) instead of master
